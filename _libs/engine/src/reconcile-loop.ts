// graph that needed several passes (e.g. a service that only becomes diff-clean once a dependency is live)
// settles within a few iterations. Errors propagate, as everywhere else; the bound guards against a graph
// that never settles. (The LLM-driven fix-operations seam — catching a failed apply to repair it — is a
// later increment that wraps this loop.)
