    // reach them over the host's internal network, never a public route. The catalog maps the abstract

    // internal-only unless given one. An app that `use`s auth gets a per-app OIDC client (OIDC_ISSUER /

    // registry, infra control, deployment target, domain) and the support stack that meets them — on the host
    // I declared, exposed through the Cloudflare I declared — and exports the app's telemetry to `obs`. The
    // `platform` team owns the app: its org owns the repo (the repo + image namespace) and its members get
    // write on the repo + Komodo execute on the deployments.
    // `use` wires the backing capabilities: intentic mints a per-app database + role and a per-app Valkey ACL
    // user, then injects DATABASE_URL and VALKEY_URL/REDIS_URL into every deployment (no manual env wiring).
