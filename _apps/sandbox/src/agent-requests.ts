/* In-memory bridges that let an in-flight agent turn pause and wait for the user. When the model
 * calls ExitPlanMode we surface the plan and block until the user approves/rejects; when it asks
 * interactive questions we block until the user answers. Decisions/answers arrive on separate
 * `POST /agent/decision` / `POST /agent/answer` requests and resolve the paused promise here.
 *
 * The daemon is single-tenant (one container per project, reached only via the trusted runner /
 * authenticated edge), so requests are keyed by an unguessable id alone — no per-user scoping. */
