// concurrent runs — a laptop and CI, or two operators — cannot interleave mutations and corrupt infra. The
// lock lives ON the contended resource (the host), reachable even at cold bootstrap; it is NOT a state file.
//
// Safety model: acquisition is an atomic `mkdir` of the lock dir (test-and-set). The lock carries a random
// `nonce`; `verify` re-checks our nonce is still in place before destructive steps. `expiresAt` is only a
// hint telling OTHER runs when an abandoned lock may be taken over — it never self-invalidates a live holder
// (verify checks the nonce, not the clock). So a stale-TTL takeover does not silently create two writers:
// the run whose nonce was overwritten fails its next `verify` and aborts. This is "no blind TTL takeover".
